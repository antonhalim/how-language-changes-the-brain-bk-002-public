# How Language Changes the Brain

This lab has four sections: an podcast, a video, and two sets of instructions.

## Radiolab Podcast: Words that Change the World

Susan Schaller believes that the best idea she ever had in her life had to do with an isolated young man she met one day at a community college. He was 27-years-old at the time, and though he had been born deaf, no one had ever taught him to sign. He had lived his entire life without language--until Susan found a way to reach out to him. 

Charles Fernyhough doesn't think that very young children think--at least not in a way he'd recognize as thinking. Charles explains what he means by walking us through an experiment in a white room. And Elizabeth Spelke weighs in with research from her baby lab--which suggests a child's brain begins as a series of islands, until it can find the right words and phrases to bridge the gaps. 

Listen to [the podcast here](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91728-words-that-change-the-world/). You don't have to listen to James Shapiro's Shakespeare section, although it's also amazing so feel free to.

## Bret Victor's Video: The Humane Representation of Thought

Watch at least the first half of Victor's keynote [here](https://vimeo.com/115154289).

##### Abstract

> New representations of thought — written language, mathematical notation, information graphics, etc — have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity’s collectively-thinkable territory.

> But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.

> Like any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But it is also enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned.

> We are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought.

> But the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities — all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding — instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest.

> This talk suggests how each of the human activities in which thought is externalized (conversing, presenting, reading, writing, etc) can be redesigned around such representations.

## Instructions - Pt. 1

Write a blog post reflecting on the content and questions below:

* How does language affect the brain?
* If language changes what our brain is capable of thinking, how might learning to program change how we think?
* Have you noticed how you think changing? If you have, is it for better or worse?
* How might programming language choice change how you think? Could it affect what problems you can solve and how you approach solving problems?
* Could your editor affect your ability to think/program?
* How might the medium in which you program affect your programs and thoughts?

When you are finished writing, remember to proof-read for spelling mistakes and grammatical errors and add your post to `lib/blog_post.txt`. Save, then run your testing suite and make sure it passes. Finally, add, commit, and submit a pull request, just as you would a typical lab.

## Instructions - Pt. 2

On Tuesday morning, take a look at a fellow student's pull request. Read what they wrote for this assignment and respond to it by making a comment on their pull request. 

Should you notice any spelling, grammatical, or structure errors, let them know as well, though this should be treated as more of an afterthought than the focus of your comment.
